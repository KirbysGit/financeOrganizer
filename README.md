# üí∞ Centi - Your Friendly Finance Companion

> **Simple, beautiful, and insightful financial tracking that actually makes sense.**

## üéØ What is Centi?

Centi is a personal finance tracking application designed with one simple goal: **to show you where your money is going without overwhelming you with complex interfaces.**

After the closure of Mint, I realized how much I missed having a simple, friendly way to track my finances. Most financial apps today focus on complex data formatting and take a brutalist approach to user experience. Centi is different - it's built around the idea that financial insights should be welcoming, not intimidating.

## ‚ú® What Makes Centi Special?

- **Immediate Insights**: When you log in, you should immediately see "Oh, that's where my money is going"

### üß† **Smart Financial Intelligence**
- **Centi Score**: A personalized financial health metric unique to your situation
- **Personalized Insights**: Financial advice based on your unique financial background
- **Growth Tracking**: Monitor your financial progress over time

### üîó **Multiple Connection Options**

Centi's design philosophy centers around **progressive disclosure** and **user comfort**:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with high-level insights that are easy to understand
