# üí∞ Centi - Your Friendly Finance Companion

> **Simple, beautiful, and insightful financial tracking that actually makes sense.**

## üéØ What is Centi?

Centi is a personal finance tracking application designed with one simple goal: **to show you where your money is going without overwhelming you with complex interfaces.**

After the closure of Mint, I realized how much I missed having a simple, friendly way to track my finances. Most financial apps today focus on complex data formatting and take a brutalist approach to user experience. Centi is different - it's built around the idea that financial insights should be welcoming, not intimidating.

## ‚ú® What Makes Centi Special?

### üß† **Smart Financial Intelligence**
- **Centi Score**: A personalized financial health metric unique to your situation
- **Personalized Insights**: Financial advice based on your unique financial background
- **Growth Tracking**: Monitor your financial progress over time

### üîó **Multiple Connection Options**

## üé® Design Philosophy

### **The Centi Approach**
Centi's design philosophy centers around **progressive disclosure** and **user comfort**:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with high-level insights that are easy to understand
2. **Build Complexity**: Gradually introduce more detailed information as users scroll
3. **Maintain Clarity**: Never overwhelm users with too much data at once
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Use color, spacing, and typography to guide attention

### **Color Scheme & Styling**
- **Primary Colors**: Blues and greens that feel trustworthy and financial
- **Accent Colors**: Warm tones for positive financial indicators
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts that don't strain the eyes
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace to prevent cognitive overload

## üîÆ Future Vision

This is just the beginning! Centi is designed to grow into a comprehensive financial companion that truly puts user experience first. Future plans include:

- **Enhanced Analytics**: More sophisticated financial insights
